1/ Run npm install to install gruntjs modules<br />
2/ Run grunt inside progressbars folder for automate process<br /><br />

Following feature has been developed:<br /><br />

· Multiple bars<br />
· One set of controls that can control each bar on the fly<br />
· Can't go under 0<br />
· Can go over 100, but limit the bar itself and change its colour<br />
· Display usage amount, centered<br />
· Consider animating the bar change<br />
· Consider linear gradient for the bar -> Not implemented<br />
· Consider a responsive solution: testing it on mobile, tablet, etc. Getting it working nicely.<br />
· Publish your code online somewhere: github or something like plnkr.co, jsfiddle.net<br /><br />

Bonus points for implementing "production quality" code, using practices such as:<br />
· Setting it up as a project<br />
· Setting up some automated tools -> using gruntjs<br />
· Writing tests for your code (TDD would be nice) -> test file is inside test folder<br />
· Version control (git)<br />
· Linting, code quality, etc - using IDE builtin Linting<br />
· JavaScript/CSS minification, packaging, etc   -> using gruntjs htmlmin and cssmin modules<br />
· Using a CSS preprocessor like SASS/SCSS   -> Using IDE builtin SASS watch and compile to css on the fly<br />
